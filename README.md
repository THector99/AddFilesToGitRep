# AddFilesToGitRep
This python/exe file will quickly make posting to your own repository easy and less painfull.
It is now fully automatic and doesn't require you to type the filenames anymore.
To use it double click the script and it will first update all files that have been modified or created and push them to your branch.
After that it will look if any file have been deleted in your folder, if so it will remove it from your branch.
